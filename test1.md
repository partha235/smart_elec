To calculate the energy spent (or more accurately, the power consumed) when converting voltages from **220V to 12V** and **110V to 12V**, we need to consider the efficiency of the voltage converter (e.g., a transformer, buck converter, or power supply) and the power requirements of the load. Energy "spent" typically refers to the power losses during conversion, as no conversion process is 100% efficient. Below, I’ll break it down step-by-step, assuming a typical scenario and addressing both cases.

### Key Assumptions
1. **Load Power**: The energy consumed depends on the power drawn by the device connected to the 12V output. Let’s assume a common load, such as a 12V device drawing **60W** (e.g., a 12V LED strip or device with 5A current, since P = V × I = 12V × 5A = 60W).
2. **Converter Efficiency**: Most modern switching power supplies or buck converters have efficiencies between **85% and 95%**. I’ll use an efficiency of **90%** (η = 0.9) for calculations, as this is typical for good-quality converters.
3. **Input Voltage**: We’ll calculate for both **220V AC** and **110V AC** input, converting to **12V DC**.
4. **Power Loss**: The energy "spent" during conversion is the power lost as heat due to inefficiency, calculated as the difference between input and output power.
5. **Time Frame**: Energy is power integrated over time (E = P × t). I’ll calculate power losses first, then provide energy for a specific duration (e.g., 1 hour) if needed.
6. **AC to DC Conversion**: Since 220V and 110V are typically AC, and 12V output is DC, we assume a standard AC-to-DC converter (e.g., a switching power supply). For simplicity, I’ll ignore power factor unless specified, assuming it’s close to 1 for modern converters.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

#### **1. Power Output (Load)**
The output power required by the 12V device is:
$$ P_{\text{out}} = 60 \, \text{W} $$

#### **2. Power Input**
The input power to the converter accounts for efficiency losses:
$$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{\eta} $$
$$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{60}{0.9} = 66.67 \, \text{W} $$

This input power is the same for both 220V and 110V inputs, as the output power and efficiency determine the input power, not the input voltage directly.

#### **3. Power Loss (Energy "Spent")**
The power lost during conversion is:
$$ P_{\text{loss}} = P_{\text{in}} - P_{\text{out}} $$
$$ P_{\text{loss}} = 66.67 - 60 = 6.67 \, \text{W} $$

This loss is the same for both 220V and 110V inputs, as it depends on the efficiency and output power, not the input voltage.

#### **4. Current Draw**
While not directly asked, it’s useful to understand the input current to ensure the system is practical:
- **For 220V AC**:
  $$ I_{\text{in}} = \frac{P_{\text{in}}}{V_{\text{in}}} = \frac{66.67}{220} \approx 0.303 \, \text{A} $$
- **For 110V AC**:
  $$ I_{\text{in}} = \frac{66.67}{110} \approx 0.606 \, \text{A} $$

The higher current at 110V is expected, as lower voltage requires more current to deliver the same power.

#### **5. Energy Spent (Losses Over Time)**
If we assume the device runs for **1 hour**, the energy lost (in watt-hours) is:
$$ E_{\text{loss}} = P_{\text{loss}} \times t = 6.67 \, \text{W} \times 1 \, \text{h} = 6.67 \, \text{Wh} $$

To convert to kilowatt-hours (kWh), commonly used for billing:
$$ E_{\text{loss}} = \frac{6.67}{1000} = 0.00667 \, \text{kWh} $$

This energy loss is the same for both 220V and 110V conversions, as it depends on the converter’s efficiency and load, not the input voltage.


### **Results**
- **220V to 12V Conversion**:
  - Input Power: **66.67 W**
  - Power Loss: **6.67 W**
  - Energy Loss (1 hour): **6.67 Wh** or **0.00667 kWh**
  - Input Current: **0.303 A**
- **110V to 12V Conversion**:
  - Input Power: **66.67 W**
  - Power Loss: **6.67 W**
  - Energy Loss (1 hour): **6.67 Wh** or **0.00667 kWh**
  - Input Current: **0.606 A**

### **Key Observations**
- The **energy spent** (power loss) is identical for both 220V and 110V inputs because the loss depends on the converter’s efficiency and the output power, not the input voltage.
- The **current draw** is higher for 110V, which may require thicker wiring or higher-rated components to handle the increased current safely.
- If the converter’s efficiency is lower (e.g., 80%), losses increase:
  $$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{60}{0.8} = 75 \, \text{W}, \quad P_{\text{loss}} = 75 - 60 = 15 \, \text{W} $$
  This would result in **15 Wh** of energy loss per hour.
- For a different load (e.g., 100W instead of 60W), scale the calculations proportionally:
  $$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{100}{0.9} = 111.11 \, \text{W}, \quad P_{\text{loss}} = 111.11 - 100 = 11.11 \, \text{W} $$

### **Practical Considerations for a Smart Home**
- **Converter Choice**: Use a high-efficiency switching power supply (90%+ efficiency) to minimize losses. Linear transformers are less efficient (~60–80%) and waste more energy.
- **Wiring and Safety**: For 110V systems, ensure wiring and breakers can handle the higher current. Smart electrical panels (e.g., SPAN, Schneider Wiser) can monitor these loads in real time.
- **Energy Monitoring**: Integrate smart plugs or panels to track power usage and optimize efficiency, as discussed in the smart electrical system overview.
- **Cost Impact**: At an average electricity rate of $0.15/kWh, the cost of 6.67 Wh (0.00667 kWh) of loss per hour is negligible (~$0.001/hour). However, for high-power or continuous-use devices, losses add up over time.

### **If You Need More Specificity**
- **Different Load**: If your 12V device has a different power rating (e.g., 10W, 100W), provide the wattage or current, and I can recalculate.
- **Converter Efficiency**: If you know the specific efficiency of your converter (e.g., 85% or 95%), I can adjust the calculations.
- **Time Duration**: Specify a different time frame (e.g., 24 hours, 1 month) for total energy loss.
- **Cost Calculation**: Provide your electricity rate (e.g., $/kWh) for a cost estimate of the losses.

Let me know if you want a chart to visualize the power losses or further details for your specific setup!

To determine which configuration—**10 LEDs in parallel** or **10 LEDs in series**—has **less power consumption** for LEDs with a forward voltage of **3V** each, we need to analyze the electrical characteristics of both setups. Since the LEDs are powered by a **12V DC** supply (based on your previous query about 12V systems), and we're converting from **220V AC** (India’s standard), we’ll calculate the total power consumption, including conversion losses from 220V AC to 12V DC. The goal is to compare the power drawn from the 220V AC source for both configurations.

### **Key Assumptions**
- **LED Specifications**: Each LED has a forward voltage of **3V** and a typical current of **20mA** (0.02A), common for standard LEDs. Power per LED: $ P_{\text{LED}} = V \times I = 3V \times 0.02A = 0.06W $ (60mW).
- **Total LEDs**: 10 LEDs in each configuration.
- **Power Supply**: 12V DC output from a 220V AC to 12V DC converter (SMPS) with **90% efficiency** (based on previous calculations for 220V in India).
- **Resistors**: In series, a current-limiting resistor is needed for the string. In parallel, each LED needs its own resistor. Resistor power losses will be included.
- **No Voltage Drop Variations**: All LEDs are identical, with a precise 3V drop at 20mA.
- **DC System**: The 12V DC supply is stable, and we focus on steady-state operation.

### **1. Series Configuration**
In a **series circuit**, the LEDs are connected end-to-end, so the same current flows through all LEDs, and the voltage drops add up.

- **Total Voltage**: 
  $$ V_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 3V = 30V $$
  This exceeds the 12V supply, so a series configuration with 10 LEDs at 3V each is **not feasible** without a higher-voltage supply or fewer LEDs. To make it work with 12V, we’d need a maximum of 4 LEDs (4 × 3V = 12V), but let’s assume you meant a configuration that fits 12V (e.g., adjusting the number of LEDs or using a hypothetical setup for comparison). Instead, I’ll analyze a **practical series setup** with **4 LEDs** (12V / 3V = 4) and scale to 10 LEDs later if needed.

#### **Series: 4 LEDs (to fit 12V)**
- **Voltage**: 4 LEDs × 3V = 12V (matches the supply, no resistor needed for simplicity, assuming ideal conditions).
- **Current**: 20mA (0.02A) through the string.
- **Power for LEDs**:
  $$ P_{\text{LEDs}} = V_{\text{total}} \times I = 12V \times 0.02A = 0.24W $$
- **Converter Input Power** (220V AC to 12V DC, 90% efficiency):
  $$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{\eta} = \frac{0.24}{0.9} \approx 0.267W $$
- **Power Loss in Converter**:
  $$ P_{\text{loss}} = 0.267 - 0.24 = 0.027W $$
- **Total Power from 220V**:
  $$ P_{\text{total, series}} = 0.267W $$
- **Note**: For 10 LEDs in series, you’d need ~30V, requiring a different power supply (e.g., 220V AC to 30V DC). If you want this, I can calculate, but it’s not practical for a 12V system.

#### **Scaling to 10 LEDs (Series)**:
Since 10 LEDs in series require 30V, let’s assume two strings of 5 LEDs (15V per string, adjusted to 12V with resistors):
- **Per String (5 LEDs)**:
  - Voltage: 5 × 3V = 15V.
  - Resistor needed: $ V_{\text{resistor}} = 12V - 15V $ (not possible, so let’s try 4 LEDs per string and add resistors).
- **Two Strings of 4 LEDs** (8 LEDs total, closest to 10):
  - Each string: 4 × 3V = 12V, 20mA.
  - Total current: 2 × 0.02A = 0.04A.
  - Power: $ 12V \times 0.04A = 0.48W $.
  - Converter input: $ \frac{0.48}{0.9} \approx 0.533W $.
  - Total power: **0.533W**.

For 10 LEDs, you’d need a custom setup (e.g., 30V supply). Let’s try parallel for a fairer comparison.

### **2. Parallel Configuration**
In a **parallel circuit**, each LED is connected directly across the 12V supply, with a current-limiting resistor per LED to drop the excess voltage.

- **Voltage per LED**: 3V (LED) + resistor to drop $ 12V - 3V = 9V $.
- **Resistor Calculation** (for 20mA per LED):
  $$ R = \frac{V_{\text{resistor}}}{I} = \frac{9V}{0.02A} = 450\Omega $$
- **Power per Resistor**:
  $$ P_{\text{resistor}} = I^2 \times R = (0.02)^2 \times 450 = 0.18W $$
- **Power per LED + Resistor**:
  - LED: $ 3V \times 0.02A = 0.06W $.
  - Total per branch: $ 0.06W + 0.18W = 0.24W $.
- **Total for 10 LEDs**:
  $$ P_{\text{LEDs + resistors}} = 10 \times 0.24W = 2.4W $$
- **Current Draw**:
  $$ I_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 0.02A = 0.2A $$
  $$ P_{\text{out}} = 12V \times 0.2A = 2.4W \ (confirms\ calculation) $$
- **Converter Input Power** (90% efficiency):
  $$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{2.4}{0.9} \approx 2.67W $$
- **Power Loss in Converter**:
  $$ P_{\text{loss}} = 2.67 - 2.4 = 0.27W $$
- **Total Power from 220V**:
  $$ P_{\text{total, parallel}} = 2.67W $$

### **3. Comparison**
- **Series (8 LEDs, 2 strings of 4, closest practical for 12V)**:
  - Total Power (220V): **0.533W**.
  - LEDs: 8 × 0.06W = 0.48W.
  - Note: 10 LEDs in series isn’t feasible with 12V without a custom supply.
- **Parallel (10 LEDs)**:
  - Total Power (220V): **2.67W**.
  - LEDs: 10 × 0.06W = 0.6W.
  - Resistors: 10 × 0.18W = 1.8W (significant loss).

**Power Consumption**:
- The **series configuration** (for 8 LEDs) uses **less power** (0.533W vs. 2.67W) because it avoids the high resistor losses of the parallel setup.
- In parallel, each LED requires a resistor that dissipates 0.18W, leading to 1.8W of wasted power for 10 LEDs, while series minimizes resistor use (none needed for 4 LEDs per string at 12V).

### **Why Series is Better**
- **Efficiency**: Series reduces current draw (0.04A for 8 LEDs vs. 0.2A for 10 LEDs in parallel), lowering converter losses and resistor losses.
- **Power Consumption**: Parallel wastes significant power in resistors (1.8W of 2.4W output, or 75% of output power), while series is nearly all LED power.
- **Practicality**: For 12V, series with 4 LEDs per string (or fewer) is ideal. For 10 LEDs, use multiple series strings (e.g., 3 strings of 3 LEDs + resistors) to stay within 12V.

### **Recommendation for 10 LEDs on 12V**
To power **10 LEDs** (3V, 20mA each) efficiently on a 12V DC supply (from 220V AC):
- Use **3 strings of 3 LEDs** in series (9V per string) with a **150Ω resistor** per string to drop $ 12V - 9V = 3V $:
  - Resistor: $ R = \frac{3V}{0.02A} = 150\Omega $.
  - Resistor power: $ (0.02)^2 \times 150 = 0.06W $ per string.
  - Total power per string: $ 3 \times 0.06W + 0.06W = 0.24W $.
  - Total for 3 strings (9 LEDs): $ 3 \times 0.24W = 0.72W $.
  - Converter input: $ \frac{0.72}{0.9} = 0.8W $.
- **Add 1 LED in parallel** with a 450Ω resistor (0.24W, as calculated).
- **Total Power (9 + 1 LEDs)**:
  $$ 0.72W + 0.24W = 0.96W \ (output), \ \frac{0.96}{0.9} \approx 1.067W \ (input) $$

This hybrid (3 strings of 3 + 1 parallel) is more efficient than 10 in parallel (1.067W vs. 2.67W).

### **Final Answer**
- **Series (or hybrid series-parallel)** has **less power consumption** than parallel for 10 LEDs (3V, 20mA) on a 12V DC supply from 220V AC.
- **Example**: 9 LEDs in 3 series strings + 1 parallel LED uses ~**1.067W** (220V input) vs. **2.67W** for 10 LEDs in parallel.
- **Reason**: Series minimizes resistor losses and current draw, reducing total power and converter losses.

**Tips**:
- Use an SMPS with ≥90% efficiency.
- For 10 LEDs, configure as 3 strings of 3 LEDs (9V) + 1 LED with resistors, or consider a 30V supply for a single series string.
- Monitor with a smart plug for real-time power usage.

If you want a chart comparing power consumption or calculations for a different supply (e.g., 30V), let me know!

***

You're asking about using a **step-down converter** (e.g., a buck converter) to convert **12V DC** (from a 220V AC to 12V DC SMPS, 90% efficient, as used in India) to **3.3V DC** to power **10 LEDs** (each 3V, 20mA) in either **parallel** or **series** configurations, and comparing **power consumption** to determine which is more efficient. This introduces an additional conversion step (220V AC → 12V DC → 3.3V DC), so we’ll calculate the total power consumption from the 220V AC source for both configurations, including losses from both converters, and compare to the previous 12V direct setups. Since you mentioned a single resistor in parallel previously, I’ll assume a standard parallel setup (one resistor per LED) unless you confirm otherwise, as a single resistor for multiple LEDs is unreliable (as noted earlier).

### **Key Assumptions**
- **LED Specifications**: Each LED has a forward voltage of **3V** and requires **20mA** (0.02A). Power per LED: $ P_{\text{LED}} = 3V \times 0.02A = 0.06W $.
- **Total LEDs**: 10 LEDs.
- **First Converter**: 220V AC to 12V DC SMPS, **90% efficiency** (η₁ = 0.9, based on prior calculations for India).
- **Second Converter**: 12V DC to 3.3V DC buck converter, **85% efficiency** (η₂ = 0.85, typical for compact buck converters at low loads, per standard specs).
- **Configurations**:
  - **Parallel**: Each LED (3V, 20mA) connected to 3.3V with a small resistor to limit current.
  - **Series**: 10 LEDs require 30V, so we’ll use a hybrid (e.g., 3 strings of 3 LEDs + 1 LED) or assume a single series string with a higher voltage supply if needed, but adjust for 3.3V.
- **Resistors**: Needed to limit current to 20mA per LED or string, as 3.3V is slightly above 3V.
- **Power Consumption**: Measured as total power drawn from 220V AC, including all converter and resistor losses.

### **1. Parallel Configuration (10 LEDs, Each with Resistor)**
Each LED is connected to the 3.3V output, with a resistor to drop the excess voltage and limit current to 20mA.

- **Voltage Drop Across Resistor**:
  $$ V_{\text{resistor}} = 3.3V - 3V = 0.3V $$
- **Resistor Value**:
  $$ R = \frac{V_{\text{resistor}}}{I} = \frac{0.3V}{0.02A} = 15\Omega $$
- **Resistor Power Loss (per LED)**:
  $$ P_{\text{resistor}} = I^2 \times R = (0.02)^2 \times 15 = 0.0004 \times 15 = 0.006W $$
- **Power per LED + Resistor**:
  $$ P_{\text{branch}} = P_{\text{LED}} + P_{\text{resistor}} = 0.06W + 0.006W = 0.066W $$
- **Total Output Power (10 LEDs)**:
  $$ P_{\text{out, 3.3V}} = 10 \times 0.066W = 0.66W $$
- **Current Draw at 3.3V**:
  $$ I_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 0.02A = 0.2A $$
  $$ P_{\text{out, 3.3V}} = 3.3V \times 0.2A = 0.66W \ (confirms\ calculation) $$
- **Input Power to 3.3V Buck Converter** (12V, 85% efficiency):
  $$ P_{\text{in, 12V}} = \frac{P_{\text{out, 3.3V}}}{\eta_2} = \frac{0.66}{0.85} \approx 0.776W $$
- **Buck Converter Loss**:
  $$ P_{\text{loss, buck}} = 0.776 - 0.66 = 0.116W $$
- **Input Power to 12V SMPS** (220V AC, 90% efficiency):
  $$ P_{\text{in, 220V}} = \frac{P_{\text{in, 12V}}}{\eta_1} = \frac{0.776}{0.9} \approx 0.862W $$
- **SMPS Loss**:
  $$ P_{\text{loss, SMPS}} = 0.862 - 0.776 = 0.086W $$
- **Total Power from 220V**:
  $$ P_{\text{total, parallel}} = 0.862W $$
- **Breakdown**:
  - LEDs: 0.6W (69.6%).
  - Resistors: 10 × 0.006W = 0.06W (7%).
  - Buck Converter: 0.116W (13.5%).
  - SMPS: 0.086W (10%).

### **2. Series Configuration (Hybrid for 10 LEDs)**
10 LEDs in series require 30V (10 × 3V), which exceeds 3.3V or 12V. To fit 3.3V, we can only power **1 LED per string** (since 2 × 3V = 6V > 3.3V). Thus, a series configuration on 3.3V reduces to **10 LEDs in parallel** (each with a resistor), identical to the parallel case above. To make a meaningful comparison, let’s use the **previous 12V series hybrid** (3 strings of 3 LEDs + 1 LED) and adapt it to include the 12V-to-3.3V step-down for fairness, or assume a single series string with a different supply later if needed.

Let’s try **3 strings of 1 LED** (3V each) on 3.3V to keep it consistent with the 3.3V supply:
- **Per LED (effectively parallel, as 3.3V limits series)**:
  - Resistor: $ \frac{3.3V - 3V}{0.02A} = 15\Omega $.
  - Resistor power: $ (0.02)^2 \times 15 = 0.006W $.
  - Power per LED + resistor: 0.066W.
  - Total for 10 LEDs: Same as parallel (0.66W output, 0.862W input from 220V).

Since 3.3V limits series connections to 1 LED per string, the **series and parallel calculations are identical** on a 3.3V supply:
- **Total Power from 220V**: **0.862W**.

### **3. Comparison to Previous 12V Setup**
From the prior response (10 LEDs on 12V DC directly):
- **Parallel (10 LEDs, individual resistors)**:
  - Resistor: $ \frac{12V - 3V}{0.02A} = 450\Omega $.
  - Resistor power: $ (0.02)^2 \times 450 = 0.18W $.
  - Total output: 10 × (0.06W + 0.18W) = 2.4W.
  - Input (220V, 90% efficiency): $ \frac{2.4}{0.9} = 2.67W $.
- **Series (Hybrid: 3 strings of 3 + 1 LED)**:
  - Output: 0.96W (0.6W LEDs + 0.36W resistors).
  - Input (220V): $ \frac{0.96}{0.9} \approx 1.067W $.

**With 3.3V Step-Down**:
- Both parallel and series (effectively parallel due to 3.3V limit) use **0.862W** from 220V.
- Compared to 12V:
  - **Parallel**: 0.862W (3.3V) vs. 2.67W (12V) → **3.3V is better** due to lower resistor losses (0.06W vs. 1.8W).
  - **Series (Hybrid)**: 0.862W (3.3V) vs. 1.067W (12V) → **3.3V is better** due to fewer resistors and lower voltage drop.

### **4. Why 3.3V is More Efficient**
- **Lower Resistor Losses**: Dropping 0.3V (3.3V to 3V) vs. 9V (12V to 3V) reduces resistor power loss significantly (0.006W vs. 0.18W per LED).
- **Trade-Off**: The additional buck converter introduces ~0.116W loss, but this is outweighed by saving ~1.74W in resistor losses (1.8W to 0.06W for 10 LEDs).
- **Limitation**: Series is less practical on 3.3V, as only 1 LED fits per string, making it effectively parallel.

### **5. Cost Impact (India, 220V)**
- **3.3V (Parallel/Series)**: $ 0.862W = 0.000862kWh/hour $, cost = $ 0.000862 \times 5 = ₹0.00431/hour $.
- **12V Parallel**: $ 2.67W = ₹0.01335/hour $.
- **12V Series (Hybrid)**: $ 1.067W = ₹0.00534/hour $.
- **Savings**: 3.3V saves ~₹0.009/hour vs. 12V parallel, ~₹0.001/hour vs. 12V series. Annual savings (24/7): ~₹79 vs. 12V parallel, ~₹9 vs. 12V series.

### **6. Practicality and Safety**
- **3.3V Parallel**: Safe and reliable with individual resistors. Use a buck converter (e.g., LM2596 module, ~85% efficient, ~$1 on Amazon).
- **3.3V Series**: Not practical (1 LED per string), so parallel is preferred.
- **Single Resistor (Parallel)**: If you meant one resistor for all 10 LEDs on 3.3V:
  - $ R = \frac{0.3V}{0.2A} = 1.5\Omega $.
  - $ P_{\text{resistor}} = (0.2)^2 \times 1.5 = 0.06W $.
  - Total output: 0.6W + 0.06W = 0.66W (same as above).
  - Input: 0.862W (identical). Still risky due to uneven current sharing.
- **Recommendation**: Use individual 15Ω resistors per LED on 3.3V for reliability.

### **Final Answer**
- **3.3V Step-Down (Parallel)**: **0.862W** from 220V AC, more efficient than 12V parallel (2.67W) or 12V series (1.067W) due to lower resistor losses (0.06W vs. 1.8W or 0.36W).
- **Series on 3.3V**: Infeasible (requires 30V), so parallel is the only option, consuming **0.862W**.
- **Best Choice**: Use a 12V-to-3.3V buck converter (85% efficient) and power 10 LEDs in parallel with **15Ω resistors** per LED. This minimizes power consumption (**0.862W**) and costs (~₹0.0043/hour at ₹5/kWh).
- **Note**: A single resistor for all LEDs (3.3V) yields the same power (0.862W) but is **not recommended** due to uneven current and reliability issues.

**Tips**:
- Use a high-efficiency buck converter (≥85%) and SMPS (≥90%).
- Monitor with a smart plug for real-time power usage.
- If you want 10 LEDs in series, consider a 30V DC supply (220V AC to 30V DC SMPS), which I can calculate if needed.
