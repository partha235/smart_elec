To calculate the energy spent (or more accurately, the power consumed) when converting voltages from **220V to 12V** and **110V to 12V**, we need to consider the efficiency of the voltage converter (e.g., a transformer, buck converter, or power supply) and the power requirements of the load. Energy "spent" typically refers to the power losses during conversion, as no conversion process is 100% efficient. Below, I’ll break it down step-by-step, assuming a typical scenario and addressing both cases.

### Key Assumptions
1. **Load Power**: The energy consumed depends on the power drawn by the device connected to the 12V output. Let’s assume a common load, such as a 12V device drawing **60W** (e.g., a 12V LED strip or device with 5A current, since P = V × I = 12V × 5A = 60W).
2. **Converter Efficiency**: Most modern switching power supplies or buck converters have efficiencies between **85% and 95%**. I’ll use an efficiency of **90%** (η = 0.9) for calculations, as this is typical for good-quality converters.
3. **Input Voltage**: We’ll calculate for both **220V AC** and **110V AC** input, converting to **12V DC**.
4. **Power Loss**: The energy "spent" during conversion is the power lost as heat due to inefficiency, calculated as the difference between input and output power.
5. **Time Frame**: Energy is power integrated over time (E = P × t). I’ll calculate power losses first, then provide energy for a specific duration (e.g., 1 hour) if needed.
6. **AC to DC Conversion**: Since 220V and 110V are typically AC, and 12V output is DC, we assume a standard AC-to-DC converter (e.g., a switching power supply). For simplicity, I’ll ignore power factor unless specified, assuming it’s close to 1 for modern converters.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

#### **1. Power Output (Load)**
The output power required by the 12V device is:
$$ P_{\text{out}} = 60 \, \text{W} $$

#### **2. Power Input**
The input power to the converter accounts for efficiency losses:
$$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{\eta} $$
$$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{60}{0.9} = 66.67 \, \text{W} $$

This input power is the same for both 220V and 110V inputs, as the output power and efficiency determine the input power, not the input voltage directly.

#### **3. Power Loss (Energy "Spent")**
The power lost during conversion is:
$$ P_{\text{loss}} = P_{\text{in}} - P_{\text{out}} $$
$$ P_{\text{loss}} = 66.67 - 60 = 6.67 \, \text{W} $$

This loss is the same for both 220V and 110V inputs, as it depends on the efficiency and output power, not the input voltage.

#### **4. Current Draw**
While not directly asked, it’s useful to understand the input current to ensure the system is practical:
- **For 220V AC**:
  $$ I_{\text{in}} = \frac{P_{\text{in}}}{V_{\text{in}}} = \frac{66.67}{220} \approx 0.303 \, \text{A} $$
- **For 110V AC**:
  $$ I_{\text{in}} = \frac{66.67}{110} \approx 0.606 \, \text{A} $$

The higher current at 110V is expected, as lower voltage requires more current to deliver the same power.

#### **5. Energy Spent (Losses Over Time)**
If we assume the device runs for **1 hour**, the energy lost (in watt-hours) is:
$$ E_{\text{loss}} = P_{\text{loss}} \times t = 6.67 \, \text{W} \times 1 \, \text{h} = 6.67 \, \text{Wh} $$

To convert to kilowatt-hours (kWh), commonly used for billing:
$$ E_{\text{loss}} = \frac{6.67}{1000} = 0.00667 \, \text{kWh} $$

This energy loss is the same for both 220V and 110V conversions, as it depends on the converter’s efficiency and load, not the input voltage.

### **Results**
- **220V to 12V Conversion**:
  - Input Power: **66.67 W**
  - Power Loss: **6.67 W**
  - Energy Loss (1 hour): **6.67 Wh** or **0.00667 kWh**
  - Input Current: **0.303 A**
- **110V to 12V Conversion**:
  - Input Power: **66.67 W**
  - Power Loss: **6.67 W**
  - Energy Loss (1 hour): **6.67 Wh** or **0.00667 kWh**
  - Input Current: **0.606 A**

### **Key Observations**
- The **energy spent** (power loss) is identical for both 220V and 110V inputs because the loss depends on the converter’s efficiency and the output power, not the input voltage.
- The **current draw** is higher for 110V, which may require thicker wiring or higher-rated components to handle the increased current safely.
- If the converter’s efficiency is lower (e.g., 80%), losses increase:
  $$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{60}{0.8} = 75 \, \text{W}, \quad P_{\text{loss}} = 75 - 60 = 15 \, \text{W} $$
  This would result in **15 Wh** of energy loss per hour.
- For a different load (e.g., 100W instead of 60W), scale the calculations proportionally:
  $$ P_{\text{in}} = \frac{100}{0.9} = 111.11 \, \text{W}, \quad P_{\text{loss}} = 111.11 - 100 = 11.11 \, \text{W} $$

### **Practical Considerations for a Smart Home**
- **Converter Choice**: Use a high-efficiency switching power supply (90%+ efficiency) to minimize losses. Linear transformers are less efficient (~60–80%) and waste more energy.
- **Wiring and Safety**: For 110V systems, ensure wiring and breakers can handle the higher current. Smart electrical panels (e.g., SPAN, Schneider Wiser) can monitor these loads in real time.
- **Energy Monitoring**: Integrate smart plugs or panels to track power usage and optimize efficiency, as discussed in the smart electrical system overview.
- **Cost Impact**: At an average electricity rate of $0.15/kWh, the cost of 6.67 Wh (0.00667 kWh) of loss per hour is negligible (~$0.001/hour). However, for high-power or continuous-use devices, losses add up over time.

### **If You Need More Specificity**
- **Different Load**: If your 12V device has a different power rating (e.g., 10W, 100W), provide the wattage or current, and I can recalculate.
- **Converter Efficiency**: If you know the specific efficiency of your converter (e.g., 85% or 95%), I can adjust the calculations.
- **Time Duration**: Specify a different time frame (e.g., 24 hours, 1 month) for total energy loss.
- **Cost Calculation**: Provide your electricity rate (e.g., $/kWh) for a cost estimate of the losses.
